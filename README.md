# SMS Spam Detection System
We will be using the SMS Spam Collection Dataset which tags 5,574 text messages based on whether they are “spam” or “ham”.
Our goal is to build a predictive model which will determine whether a text message is spam or ham.

## Motivation
Nowadays we get a lot of junk sms messages, which we prefer to divide into "ham" or "spam".
